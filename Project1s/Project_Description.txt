                     Project Description

To prepare for this assignment, we read the GLSL ES Specification manual to understand
the forms for the different variable types. Also, we learned the three different sections
to flex files: definitions, rules, and user defined subroutines. The basic keyword rules
were easy to implement, however rules regarding integers, comments, truncation were harder 
for us to express.
For the rules regarding comments, we had to learn to use start conditions. We read about
this flex feature and found it to be exactly what we needed to use.
