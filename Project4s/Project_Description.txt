CSE131  Project 4 Description

For this project, we had to learn how to use the llvm compiler through piazza 
and through http://llvm.org/. We started the program by creating a symbol 
table; the structure of it is a list of maps like PA3. After creating the symbol
table, we went to ast.h and ast_stmt.cc file to initialize the symbol table.
Then we went to the ast_decl.cc and ast_decl.h file to do the FnDecl and
VarDecl. Then we went to ast_expr.cc, ast_expr.h, ast_stmt.cc, ast_stmt.h,
irgen.cc, and irgen.h file to do the rest of the program. (Ex: vectors, arrays)
