CSE131  Project 2 Description

For this project we had to read the PDF and analyze the
GLSL Specification. We decided that writing the rules/actions down
for the rule section would be the easiest way to start off. After
many failed attempts, we worked on nonterminal types to
the union brace.

For errors, the most common errors were that nonterminal
types were useless in the grammar and the some nonterminal
types were not declared in the scope. These errors were 
easily fixed by backtracking the code from the translation_unit
and figuring out why the grammars were not linked or avoided.
Also, sometimes we had duplicate rules or similar rules, so we 
had to simplify them by removing them or combining the rules.

For the conflicts, we decided to change the Makefile to 
create a debug file that allowed us to see where
there is a conflict in the code. For example, the debug
file would state there would be a conflict at "State 262."
While, scrolling through the conflicts, we found that
many of our rules created a loop and thus, the program was confused
which rules to choose at certain points. We fixed all of these 
loop cases and made changes that allowed the code to flow
more easily.

One of the hardest parts of the program assignment was figuring
out what to write for the actions in the rules section. For example,
fully_specfied_type was stated as type_qualifier and type_specifier,
however there was no way for us to return two types. So we had to
modify the other rules and use a different constructor for the rules.
Parts like this made the program challenging, however we felt like
we learned a lot from parsing by figuring out different code 
scenarios.
